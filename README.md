# The E.164 International Standard for Phone Number Format
Today, the E.164 phone number format is the international phone number formatting standard across the globe. It was originally designed so that the machines could be developed to use phone numbers reliably, and that required standardization and consistency. In modern times, the E. 164 international phone number standard helps to fuel a wealth of services and software.

This is an internationally recognized format that will work with nearly any software where itâ€™s important that those solutions are able to recognize an international country code, area codes, and the actual phone numbers themselves within the data string.

The E. 164 phone number format uses this template:

### [+][country code][area code][local phone number]
